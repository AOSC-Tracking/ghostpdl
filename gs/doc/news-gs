Thu Feb 18 23:00:00 1999                ray@artifex.com

        * gdevclj.c [1.5]:
        Change paper_sizes to clj_paper_sizes to prevent conflict (with PCL code)
        when building with NOPRIVATE=1.
        
        * wccommon.mak [1.10]:
        Add missing $(GLSRCDIR) to CP_ and RMN_ definitions. Change genconf escape
        to '~' ('^' is special in .bat files). Move .BEFORE directory creation to
        watc.mak.
        
        * watclib.mak [1.6]:
        Fix LIBPATHS syntax, put !ifndef around most definitions to allow pre-
        definition (from pcl/pxl make). Add WAT32 section to build for NT char
        mode executable.
        
        * gdevpx.c [1.6]:
        Make 'put_bytes' into 'px_put_bytes' to prevent conflict when building
        with NOPRIVATE.
        
        * watc.mak [1.8]:
        Move .BEFORE here to make directories, add missing $(GLGENDIR) for

        * gp_ntfs.c [1.4]:
        Add conditional for Watcom to use regluar setmode and fileno (not _setmode
        and _fileno).
        
        * wccommon.mak [1.9]:
        Add support for 32-bit build flag WAT32, add watcom/h/nt to include path.
        Add .BEFORE section to create object and gen directories if needed.
        
        * watc.mak [1.7]:
        Support build for 32-bit systems (95 or NT) as default. Don't include vga
        and other direct devices. Make Pentium the default CPU type, and increase
        stack size to 32k (needed for high level clist).
        

Wed Feb 17 03:00:00 1999                ray@artifex.com

        * gscdefs.h [1.5], gconf.c [1.5]:

        * gscie.c [1.7]:
        Fix condition where cie_joint_caches would not be initialized after alloc.
        Caused bad colors (near black), only detected with PCL5, not PS.
        

Tue Feb  2 04:00:00 1999                marcos@artifex.com

        * lib.mak [1.13], gsmemlok.h [1.4], gsmemlok.c [1.5], gsmalloc.h [1.4], 
        gsmalloc.c [1.7]:
        Added monitor-locking to large block allocator.
        
        * gxclrast.c [1.8]:
        Fixed degenerate triangle problem (using Peter's fix).
        
        * gsdparam.c [1.5]:
        Removed PageCount check to allow multiple page files to correctly RIP
        under async pcl.
        

Tue Feb  2 02:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gxstroke.c [1.8]:

Mon Feb  1 02:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * zgstate.c [1.4], gxstroke.c [1.6], gxline.h [1.4], gsstate.c [1.7], gsline.h [1.4], 
        gsline.c [1.4]:
        modifications to support dot orientation.  HPGL/2 dots (zero length
        lines) are always drawn parallel to the HPGL/2 X-axis.  Also, makes
        dot orientation independent of device space.

        color mapping modification to properly hand snap to primaries and snap
        black to white and other colors to white.
        

Sat Jan 30 23:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * lib.mak [1.12], genconf.c [1.5]:

Thu Jan 28 04:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gdevbmpa.c [1.12], gdevbmp.c [1.4], devs.mak [1.13]:
        32 bit cmyk driver changes (peter).
        

Sat Jan 23 19:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gxstroke.c [1.5]:
        don't try to render 0 area bevels.
        
        * gdevbmpa.c [1.11]:
        modification to produce multiple copies.
        

Wed Jan 20 09:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gxalloc.h [1.9]:
        moved debug definitions from gsalloc.c to avoid a compilation problem
        on with Watcom C (ray).
        

Tue Jan 19 16:00:00 1999                ray@artifex.com

        * gsmemraw.h [1.5]:
        Comment change to 'Resize'. If old and new size are the same, returns the
        original object. In any case the min(old,new) bytes of data are copied.
        
        * gsalloc.c [1.9]:
        Change 'resize' operations of objects/strings to return the original if
        the old and new size are the same. Also add logic to 'trim' the object/
        string if the new size is smaller than the old to avoid double
        allocations and copy step. Memory trimmed is added to free space.
        
        * gdevprn.c [1.11]:
        Add optional code to avoid sandbars for async rendering. Default is to
        free memory as in previous code. Use #define DO_NOT_REDUCE_BUFFER_SPACE 1
        to keep initial (largest) allocation when buffer space shrinks.
        
        * gsmalloc.c [1.6]:
        Make resize operations return original object/string if no size change.
        
        * gsmemory.h [1.5]:
        Add comment to 'Resize' to refer to gsmemraw.h. This comment says that if
        old and new size are the same, the original object is returned.

Version 5.50d (01/01/99)
========================

Mon Jan 14 05:00:00 1999        Ray Johnston        ray@artifex.com

        * gxp1fill.c [1.6]:
        Fix for pattern phase (Peter)

Mon Jan 13 06:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gschar.c [1.4]:
        The null device installed for stringwidth didn't copy the color
        mapping information from its target, causing confusion if the current
        device was a pattern accumulator (Peter).
        
        * gxpcmap.c [1.4], gxdevice.h [1.8], gxdevcli.h [1.6], gsdevice.c [1.8]:
        The null device installed for stringwidth didn't copy the color
        mapping information from its target, causing confusion if the current
        device was a pattern accumulator. (Peter)

Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 1999        Ray Johnston        ray@artifex.com

        * ps2ascii.ps [1.6]:
        I fixed the stdout logic, so that the output can be redirected with
        the sequence;
              /.show.stdout (outfile.txt) (w) file def
        interposed between loading (running) ps2ascii.ps and loading/running
        the file(s) to be converted.
        
        Also added a (\n) to the copypage output for the SIMPLE case to
        improve readability.

Mon Jan 12 23:00:00 1999        Ray Johnston        ray@artifex.com

        * gdevbmpa.c [1.10]:
        OOPS! Fix error caused by bad edit. See comment on previous revision.

Mon Jan 12 20:00:00 1999        Ray Johnston        ray@artifex.com

        * gdevbmpa.c [1.9]:
        Change to make sure BufferSpace allows for writer_space + min_row_space.
        Keep the code that forces writer and reader to be the same (for now).
        Replace the *** HACK HACK *** comment with something more informative.

Mon Jan 12 01:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gdevbmpa.c [1.8]:
        Hack to set buffer space and band buffer space equal.  I thought this
        was no longer necessary but bmpamono will not work correctly without
        the change, although the color bmp driver seems to work.  I have not
        analyzed this.  Also max_raster and min_band_height was calculated
        incorrectly.

        zlib/algorithm.txt [1.1], zlib/FAQ [1.1]:
        zlib 1.1.3 release - these files were not added in the original
        checkin.  We have not analyzed why they were not incorporated the
        first time.

        the fix to not free a reserved page entry is no longer handled by

        Instead we avoid freeing the information by removing the call for the
        case of reserved entries.
        
        * gdevbmpa.c [1.7]:

Mon Dec 10 16:00:00 1998        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gdevbbox.c [1.11]:
        *** empty log message ***

Mon Dec 10 08:00:00 1998        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * gxpageq.c [1.5]:
        properly initializes page information in the page queue entry when it
        is allocated.
        
        * gdevbmpa.c [1.5]:
        Fixes bug that was confusing band height and band width, also add
        workaround to set the band buffer space and the buffer space equal.
        Later the tile size cache is calculated to be different between reader
        and writer if the band buffer space and the buffer space are equal.

Version 5.50c (note 5.50c includes the 5.55 changes noted below)
================================================================

Wed Dec  2 20:32:38 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* gxpageq.h, gdevprn.c, gdevprna.c, gdevbmpa.c:
	John D's changes for async code from the 12/1 code review.  See john's
	comments in the files for details.

	* gdevbbox.c:
	hack to properly set flag for is_open in forwarding devices.

Version 5.55 (12/01/98) (released branch of ghostscript 5.50)
=====================================================

Wed Dec  2 01:28:00 1998  marcos  <marcos@artifex.com>

	* gdevprn.c:
	Changed mdev->band back to prdev->is_open in gdev_prn_maybe_reallocate_memory()
	to fix problem with 64 bit CPUs and banding mode.  This breaks PCL code
	but works for PostScript (though it may not work for forwarding devices).

Tue Dec  1 23:39:26 1998  henrys  <henrys@artifex.com>

	* gxband.h: missing initialization value.

Wed Nov 25 17:38:12 1998  ray  <ray@artifex.com>

	under Watcom.

	* wccommon.mak, unixhead.mak:
	Add definitions for compile command line defines (used in zlib.mak)

	* cp.bat: Change to make this pseudo "cp" run silently and get rid of
	annoying and misleading "File not found." message.

	* rm.bat: Change to make this pseudo "rm" run more quietly.

	* openvms.mak:
	Add definitions for compile command line defines (used in zlib.mak)

	is not a member of the structure.

	* pdf_main.ps: Fix for (illegal) PDF files that have xref offset on the
	same line as the "startxref" [ref #849].

	* gstype42.c:
	Fix for downloaded TrueType fonts that have an ID of "true"
	(caused /invalidfont error.)
	Also fix /limitcheck problem in some signed logic.

	* gp_iwatc.c: Fix for compilers (Watcom under Windows) which don't
	define "stdprn", but do support opening of "PRN".

	* genconf.c:
	Fix for build using Watcom wmake on Win 95, Win NT, where '&'
	causes problem (background execution or split command lines).

	* gdevprna.c, gxdcolor.c, gximage1.c, gxclrast.c, gxclutil.c:
	Changes made by Peter to fix banding problems discovered during
	gs550c regression testing.  Fixes problem with banded and dithered files,
	banded rgb files, and rotated PDF files.

Tue Nov 17 12:49:50 1998  ghost  <ghost@artifex.com>

	* gx.h: no-op with trivial edit
