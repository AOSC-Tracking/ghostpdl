<p>
Before using this form, please read the <a
href="Bug-info.htm">instructions</a> for reporting problems.
If you have already submitted at least two problem
reports, you can send an informal report
to the place indicated below.  Otherwise, please fill out this form
completely.  Fill out <strong>all</strong> applicable items in this form.
In particular, you <strong>must</strong> include all data (PostScript files,
PDF files, batch/script files, and/or fonts) involved in the problem, either
by giving a URL from which we can download the data, or by including the
data with the report itself.  If you don't include this information, we
can't investigate the problem.

<p>
Once you have prepared the report, you can mail it (with any attachments)
to: <a href="mailto:support@artifex.com">support@artifex.com</a>.
<p>
If you wish, you may submit the problem to the Ghostscript SourceForge
project bug tracking by going to
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=1897">
http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=1897</a>and follow the
instructions there.  Use the completed problem reporting form as the body of
the Bug Tracker submission. You will not be able to attach any files to
problems submitted to SourceForge, and all of these problems will be
visible to the public.

<p>
Fully completed problem reports help us improve Ghostscript.  Thanks in
advance.
