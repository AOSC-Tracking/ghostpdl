% helper file to simplify use of Stochastic Halftone - uses ht_ccsto.ps

% This file sets the /StochasticDefault /Halftone as the current
% and the /Default halftoning, loading the Stochastic halftone
% if required.

% Stochastic halftoning is recommended for inkjet printers, and may
% produce output as pleasing as the more computationally expensive
% "error diffusion" that *some* device drivers provide.

% For printing technologies other than inkjet, Stochastic halftoning
% may not look better than standard screening. In particular, thermal
% transfer and direct thermal tend to be better with standard ordered
% screening methods. Some laser printers may produce "smoother"
% looking gray shades with Stochastic halftoning. Try it, and if
% you like it, use it.

% Note that this /Default halftone can be overridden by PostScript
% operators that set the screening or halftone (such as setscreen).

% To make Stochastic Halftone be "sticky" so that other screening and
% halftone setting in the subsequent PostScript will be ignored, use:
%	-c "<< /HalftoneMode 1 >> setuserparams"
% on the command line prior to the file to be processed. For example,
%
% gs stocht.ps -c "<< /HalftoneMode 1 >> setuserparams" -f examples/tiger.ps

% Alternatively, the command to set the /HalftoneMode userparam can be
% concatenated to this file (see below).
