 * Scan a binary token.  The main scanner calls this iff recognize_btokens()
 * is true.  Return e_unregistered if Level 2 features are not included.
 * Return 0 or scan_BOS on success, <0 on failure.
 *
 * This header file exists only because there are two implementations of
 * this procedure: a dummy one for Level 1 systems, and the real one.
 * The interface is entirely internal to the scanner.
