 * Render an array of saved pages by setting up a modified get_bits
 * procedure and then calling the device's normal output_page procedure.
 * Any current page in the device's buffers is lost.
 * The (0,0) point of each saved page is translated to the corresponding
 * specified offset on the combined page.  (Currently the Y offset must be 0.)
 * The client is responsible for freeing the saved and placed pages.
 *
 * Note that the device instance for rendering need not be, and normally is
 * not, the same as the device from which the pages were saved, but it must
 * be an instance of the same device.  The client is responsible for
 * ensuring that the rendering device's buffer size (BufferSpace value) is
 * the same as the BandBufferSpace value of all the saved pages, and that
 * the device width is the same as the BandWidth value of the saved pages.
