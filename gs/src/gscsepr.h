 * Separation color spaces.
 *
 * The API for creating Separation color space objects exposes the fact that
 * they normally cache the results of sampling the tint_transform procedure,
 * and use the cache to convert colors when necessary.  When a language
 * interpreter sets up a Separation space, it may either provide a
 * tint_tranform procedure that will be called each time (specifying the
 * cache size as 0), or it may fill in the cache directly and provide a
 * dummy procedure.
 *
 * By default, the tint transformation procedure will simple return the
 * entries in the cache. If this function is called when the cache size is
 * 0, all color components in the alternative color space will be set to 0.
