/*
 * Define the interface for routines used to render a (source) scan line.
 * If the buffer is the original client's input data, it may be unaligned;
 * otherwise, it will always be aligned.
 *
 * The image_render procedures work on fully expanded, complete rows.  These
 * take a height argument, which is an integer >= 0; they return a negative
 * code, or the number of rows actually processed (which may be less than
 * the height).  height = 0 is a special call to indicate that there is no
 * more input data; this is necessary because the last scan lines of the
 * source data may not produce any output.
 *
 * Note that the 'w' argument of the image_render procedure is the number
 * of samples, i.e., the number of pixels * the number of samples per pixel.
 * This is neither the width in pixels nor the width in bytes (in the case
 * of 12-bit samples, which expand to 2 bytes apiece).

 * failed.  If a class procedure succeeds, it may update the enumerator
 * structure as well as returning the rendering procedure.
