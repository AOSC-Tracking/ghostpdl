 * and return 1.
 *
 * If the key is present and the length len of the value (not counting

 * *plen = len + 1, and return 0.
 *
 * If the key is present and len >= *plen, set *plen = len + 1,

 * Note that *plen is the size of the buffer, not the length of the string:
 * because of the terminating \0, the maximum string length is 1 less than
 * the size of the buffer.
