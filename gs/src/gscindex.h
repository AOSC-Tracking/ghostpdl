/*
 * Indexed color spaces.
 *
 * If the color space will use a procedure rather than a byte table,
 * ptbl should be set to 0.
 *
 * Unlike most of the other color space constructors, this one initializes
 * some of the fields of the colorspace. In the case in which a string table
 * is used for mapping, it initializes the entire structure. Note that the
 * client is responsible for the table memory in that case; the color space
 * will not free it when the color space itself is released.
 *
 * For the case of an indexed color space based on a procedure, a default
 * procedure will be provided that simply echoes the color values already in
 * the palette; the client may override these procedures by use of
 * gs_cspace_indexed_set_proc. If the client wishes to insert values into
 * the palette, it should do so by using gs_cspace_indexed_value_array, and
 * directly inserting the desired values into the array.
 *
 * If the client does insert values into the palette directly, the default
 * procedures provided by the client are fairly efficient, and there are
 * few instances in which the client would need to replace them.
