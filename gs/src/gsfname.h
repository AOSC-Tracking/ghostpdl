/*
 * Structure and procedures for parsing file names.
 *
 * Define a structure for representing a parsed file name, consisting of
 * an IODevice name in %'s, a file name, or both.  Note that the file name
 * may be either a gs_string (no terminator) or a C string (null terminator).
 *
 * NOTE: You must use parse_[real_]file_name to construct parsed_file_names.
 * Do not simply allocate the structure and fill it in.
