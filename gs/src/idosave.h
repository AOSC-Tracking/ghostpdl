 * Save a change that must be undone by restore.  We have to pass the
 * pointer to the containing object to alloc_save_change for two reasons:
 *
 *      - We need to know which VM the containing object is in, so we can
 * know on which chain of saved changes to put the new change.
 *
 *      - We need to know whether the object is an array of refs (which
 * includes dictionaries) or a struct, so we can properly trace and
 * relocate the pointer to it from the change record during garbage
 * collection.
