High Priority Problems
======================

Colorspaces other than RGB and scRGB in vector colors.
Images support grayscale, RGB and CMYK.

Gradient brushes need some work to figure out
how many times to repeat to fill the bounding box.

Need to revise arc calculations. They are often
flat out wrong or instable.

Low Priority Problems
=====================

Cap styles for different parts of a line
can be different in XPS, no support exists
in ghostscript.

WMPhoto images need a decoder and colorspace
support.

PrintTickets need to be looked into.
