? - question.
+ note.
- problem or bug.


? legality of calling Helvetica Helvetica?  font alias names.
- GS_FONTPATH does not work have to set GS_LIB to font directory.
- rename font files (.*)\.ttf -> $1
- recompiled with compile inits off for debugging
- command line option to specify init lib probably broken.
+ -Z# is useless because int control flow 
- vintage of parameter setting code?
+ annoying - chess requires cheq.ps in the working directory.
+ GS_VERSION_MAJOR=7 GS_VERSION_MINOR=01 GS_VERSION_MINOR0=01
- ridt91.ps never paints anything - showpage commented works on
  regular gs.
- Searches current directory before GS_LIB environment setting.
- waterfal.ps broken - (landscape??).
- alphabet - wrong colors in bmp devices, ppm crashes -Z@ error bad
  output w/o -Z@.
- more on ppm crashes above - in memory locking allocator - should get
  rid of locking allocator this code.  happens after the show
  pl_main_universe_dnit. - free call removed alphabet prints with gray back remove -Z@ black background
- boldening of fonts will have to be integrated in order to do testing.
