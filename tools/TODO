General
=======

o pdfwrite should require artifex font scaler.  Freetype and UFST will
not work with high level drivers.
o PCLXL 2.1.
o 80 resident pcl fonts using freetype scaler and Type 1 + TrueType
font data.
o URW font character analysis.
o Microsoft Publishing symbol set 6J has incorrect entries.
o Vertical glyph substitutions - see fts 242* panels.

Language switching
==================

o Postscript job encapsulation for the language switching environment.
o Memory leak testing.
o Device switching testing.
o Investigate Postscript font downloading persistence.

Freetype 2 integration
======================

o Needs a cache device.
o GL/2 labels with Freetype 2 are not always correct.  Problem should
go away once a cache device is installed.  HPGL/2 tries to figure out
its next position based on the "currentpoint" after rendering the
character.
o left side bearing metric is always 0.
o galley characters unsupported.
o downloaded truetypes don't work.
o pclxl algorithmic bold characters are not supported.
