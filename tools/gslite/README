gslt (gs lite)

graphics library client, sans pdl's, based on Peter's gslib.c in gs/src/.


BUILD
-----

Build a shared library object of ghostscript.

   cd ../../gs   # relative to the gslite directory.
   ln -s src/unix-gcc.mak Makefile
   make sodebug
   
Build gslite:        
  
   cd - # back to the gslite directory
   make depend
   make
   
RUN
---

The shared library can either be put in a well defined place or
something like this will work if you run the client from the same
directory each time:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../gs/sobin/

Take care to avoid a common problem: use `ldd gslt' to verify the
shared library (libgs.so.n) is the one you built above and not one
installed say in /usr/lib/

gslt <device> <testnumber>

example:

gslt x11 5

The first argument is the device, see the ghostscript library makefile
for supported devices.

example 2:

run all of the tests:

for x in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do gslt x11 $x; done
