gslt (gs lite)

graphics library client, sans pdl's, based on Peter's gslib.c in gs/src/.


BUILD
-----

Get gs and build a shared libray object, 'make sodebug` is the usual
incantantation.  This will not work with the shared language gs build,
use the latest gs build.

Modify the first variable in gs lite's Makefile `GSDIR' to point to the
gs tree where the shared library was built.  For example:
  
  GSDIR=../../gshead

type `make depend'

and then

type `make'


The shared library can either be put in a well defined place or
something like this will work if you run the client from the same
directory each time:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../gshead/sobin/

gslt <device> <testnumber>

example:

gslt x11 5

The first argument is the device, see the ghostscript library makefile
for supported devices.
