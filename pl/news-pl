Version 1.20 (9/24/98)
======================

Sat Sep 26 18:51:14 1998  Red Hat Linux User  <henrys@warthog>

	* pl.mak: changes to support msvc builds

Version 1.19 (8/17/98)
=======================

Changes:

- plmain.c: Adds include gsstruct.h

TODO:

- update include dependency lists in pl.mak

Version 1.18 (8/6/98)
=====================

Updates the makefile for the new directory structure in library version
5.30.  (pl.mak)

Changes (general improvements not associated with bugs):
    o mods for dictionary synonyms (originally implemented in 1.17)
	- pl_dict.c: pl_dict_put_links() and pl_dict_undef_purge_links()
	renamed to pl_dict_put_synonyms() and pl_dict_undef_purge_synonyms().
	- pl_dict.h: added interface document for adding a synonym to the
	dictionary.
	- pl_dict.c: renamed pl_dict_put_link() to pl_dict_put_synonym()
    o mods for font copying fonts (originally implemented in 1.17)
	- plchar.c: pl_font_add_glyph() no longer requires a
	size field for the data.  This is not necessary and broke the pl 
	interface with XL.
	- pcfont.h: no longer require glyph size in data type
	pl_font_glyph_t
	- plfont.c: pl_clone_font() code changes to support copying fonts
	without passing in the size of the glyph data  (see last 2 entries)
     o symbol set types
        - jan's additions to correct printable character ranges in symbol set's          as suggested by Peter plsymbol.c

Fixes for gs5.28 compatibility:
        - plmain.c: added gsmalloc.h for gs_memory_default and removed
	obsolete extern for gs_malloc_limit.

Version 1.17 (2/10/98)
=====================

Fixes bugs:
        - symbol set typos.
        - key mapping not using mod 64K arithmetic.  (plchar.c)

New stuff:
        - Updates the dictionary to support adding and deletion of
	aliases or links.  Supports new pcl command that can create aliases
	for font and macro id's PCL alphanumeric id data command (pldict.c,
	pldict.h)

        - Added copy font facilily to make a copy of a "plfont".
	Supports Assign font id to copy of current font (ESC * c 6 F).
	(plfont.c)

	- Moved intellifont code to pl to be consistant with the other
	fonts and to support copying of fonts. (plfont.c, plchar.c)

Version 1.16 (9/4/97)
=====================

Fixes bugs:
	- The Math-8 (8M) symbol set mapped many Greek characters to math
symbols rather than the Greek alphabet, and had a couple of other typos.
(plsymbol.c)
	- The Roman-8 (8U) symbol set mapped character 0x7e to the section
symbol rather than the tilde.  (plsymbol.c)
	- The width of an undefined TrueType glyph was returned as 0 rather
than as the width of glyph 0.  (plchar.c)
	- The Roman-8 (8U) symbol set was marked incorrectly as requiring
the PCL extensions (bit 25).  (plsymbol.c)

Adds the 0E (5) symbol set, an undocumented symbol set containing the
extended character set for the HP-GL/2 stick font.  (plsymbol.c)

Adds tracing (with -Zj / -ZJ) to the TrueType character mapper.  (plchar.c)

Version 1.15 (8/15/97)
======================

Fixes bugs:
	- The Deskop (7J) symbol set data were incorrect -- apparently a
copy of the Roman-8 data.  (plsymbol.c)
	- The entries for the ~ character in the ISO ASCII (0U) and
Norwegian (0D) symbol sets were incorrect.  (We suspect there are quite a
few more incorrect entries.)  (plsymbol.c)

Changes the computation of the nominal font width to use the 'x' character
rather than the space character, since the latter may be very narrow in some
proportionally spaced fonts.  (plfont.c)

Changes the character width/existence computation for TrueType fonts to
recognize 0 as denoting an undefined character.  (plchar.c)

Version 1.14 (5/12/97)
======================

Changes the pitch_100ths field of font parameters into two new fields:
pitch.cp (centipoints) and pitch.per_inch_x100 (character/inch * 100).
Previously there was confusion as to the meaning of pitch_100ths.  Note that
this is a NON-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE change.  (plfont.h, plfont.c)

Version 1.13 (4/13/97)
======================

Fixes bugs:
	- The count of the number of entries in a dictionary wasn't
initialized.  (pldict.c)
	- The character complements for most of the symbol maps were wrong.
(They probably are still wrong, but they're closer to being right.)
(plsymbol.c)
	- Many occurrences of the DEGREE SIGN were incorrectly entered as
RING OPERATOR.  (plsymbol.c)
	- The map from MSL to Unicode was incomplete.  (plvocab.c)
	- The FontBBox for preloaded TrueType files contained garbage when
gs_type42_font_init was called, possibly causing a floating point exception.
(It was set to the correct value later.)  (plfont.c)

Makes the command line parser ignore -dBATCH, for compatibility with the
PostScript/PDF command line.  (plmain.c)

Adds a procedure for deleting a glyph from a font.  This is needed to
implement the corresponding PCL5 command.  (plfont.h, plchar.c)

Adds procedures for mapping between MSL and Unicode.  (plvocab.h, plvocab.c)

Exports the pl_font_lookup_glyph procedure so that the PCL5 Intellifont
rasterizer can call it.  (plfont.h, plchar.c)

Version 1.12 (3/26/97)
======================

This is the first numbered fileset.

Updates a get_outline procedure to match a change in the GS library.
(plchar.c)

Renames and restructures the makefile, in preparation for the move to CVS.
(pcllib.mak => pl.mak, pl_h.mak, pl_ugcc.mak, pl_watc.mak)

Pre-tracking changes
====================

Before 3/1/97, we did not track this library as a separate released object;
we included it in PCL5 and PCL XL releases.  Therefore, older changes are
noted only by date.

2/21/97
-------

Fixes bugs:
	- pl_dict_lookup returned false rather than NULL in the failure
case.  (This didn't affect its functioning, only its readability.)
(pldict.c)
	- The parameter lists for macros accessing font_char_width functions
were incorrect.  (plfont.h)
	- There was a duplicate entry for Unicode 19U.  (plsymbol.c)
	- TrueType fonts didn't set the pitch_100ths value in the font
structure.  (plfont.h, plfont.c)

Extends the dictionary interface to allow lookups with or without searching
the stack.  (pldict.h, pldict.c)

2/6/97
------

Fixes bugs:
	- In downloaded fonts with more than about 300 characters, some
characters could get lost.  (plchar.c)

1/30/97
-------

Adds recognition of @-files on the command line.  (pcllib.mak, plmain.h,
plmain.c)

1/24/97
-------

Adds a -K<maxK> switch to impose a limit on the total space allocated.
(plmain.c)

Includes the time and memory printing code even in non-DEBUG configurations.
(plmain.c)

1/21/97 (after PCL XL 1.08)
-------

Makes the command line interpreter recognize # as equivalent to =, to get
around the Watcom implementation's bug of making = equivalent to space.
(plmain.c)

1/18/97
-------

Makes available the procedure for looking up a value in a TrueType-style
cmap sub-table, since we plan to use it for mapping between glyph
vocabularies.  (plfont.h, plchar.c)

1/15/97
-------

Corrects some minor errors in the symbol sets, and resolves the issue of the
duplicate Desktop set.  (plsymbol.c)

1/13/97
-------

Updates the dingbats symbol sets to be more complete, and to use a MSL
mapping.  (plsymbol.c)

1/10/97
-------

Initializes the new library accurate curves flag to true.  (plmain.c)

1/9/97
------

Moves code for printing usage statistics (time, # of pages printed, memory
usage) into the library.  (plmain.h, plmain.c)

Limits the size of the initially allocated glyph tables, in case a client
asks for an unreasonably large one (as do some of the Genoa tests).
(plchar.c)

Corrects a misleading error message.  (plmain.c)

Greatly speeds up the generation of pseudo-bold characters, by replacing an
O(N) algorithm with an O(log N) one.  (plchar.c)
