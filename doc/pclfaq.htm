<h1>
GhostPCL5 FAQ</h1>

<hr>
<p>This page discusses configuration, compilation and running of the&nbsp;
PCL family of products:&nbsp; GhostPCL5E, GhostPCL5c and GhostPXL.&nbsp;
All of the PCL products use the Ghostscript Graphic Library for graphics,
imaging and driver support.&nbsp; Please see the ghostscript faq for additional
information:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/faq.html">Ghostscript
FAQ.</a>
<p>1. Character rasterization at low resolution is poor, what do I do?
<blockquote>Use -dTextAlphaBits=4 to enable antialiasing, the default TrueType
font scaler does not use hints.</blockquote>
2. PCL and PXL aren't web file formats, how do I web publish&nbsp; or email
them?
<blockquote>Convert to PDF using the pdfwrite2 device
<br>pcl2pdf infile outfile
<br>PCL and PXL conversion to PDF isn't finished ie alpha.</blockquote>
3. PCL to PDF text is at low resolution and not selectable/searchable?
<blockquote>PCL text can actually be raster this will end up as a raster
in the pdf file resulting in a low quality non-searchable PDF. This is
common with older windows drivers. Choosing a newer driver may output text
and fonts resulting in a searchable PDF when converted.</blockquote>
4. Some PCL and PXL files don't convert well to PDF.
<blockquote>Raster logical operations (ROPS)are currently not supportd
in pdfwrite2.&nbsp; More generally pcl to pdf lacks rigorous testing.</blockquote>
5. Where are the binaries?
<blockquote>We do not release binaries, developers are the intended audience.</blockquote>
