Version 1.07 (01/01/99)
=======================

Mon Jan  6 22:00:00 1999        Marcos H. Woehrmann        marcos@artifex.com

        * watcdefs.mak [1.4], sgidefs.mak [1.4], msvcdefs.mak [1.5], gccdefs.mak [1.4]:
        Fixed problem with version number under msvc (and watcom).

Mon Jan  4 05:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * ugcc_top.mak [1.13]:
        Changes to allow use of make -f <top level makefile>.  It is no longer
        necessary to create a copy or link of the top level makefile, thought
        it is still supported.

Mon Dec 22 20:00:00 1998        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * watc_top.mak [1.3], ugcc_top.mak [1.12], sgi_top.mak [1.6], msvc_top.mak [1.9]:
        Prefixes devices with $(DD) and moves zlib configuration variable
        initialization to the to the top level unix makefiles.  Someone else
        will need to check the other makefile systems.  This change requires
        that we set ZLIB variable in # PLATFORMS SUPPORTED * 2 (pcl and XL)
        places instead of one, but will allow the code to be compiled with
        gs5.66.

Mon Dec  9 05:00:00 1998        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * NEWS-COM [1.8]:
