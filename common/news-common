        * ugcc_top.mak [1.14]:

        well.
        

Wed Feb 24 12:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

Version 1.08 (02/14/99)
=======================

Thu Feb 18 23:00:00 1999                ray@artifex.com

        * watc_top.mak [1.4]:
        Fix problems for make under Watcom. Use GLSRCDIR (not GSDIR), instead of
        'type' to update time stamp, use >> (prevents file truncation). Use '~'
        as the genconf escape character (special in .bat files). Increase stack
        to 32K (needed for high level clists). Correct some missing directory
        prefixes.
        
        * cp.bat [1.3]:
        Prevent 'not_found' error on _.tmp temp file
        

Thu Feb 11 18:00:00 1999                ray@artifex.com

        * unixdefs.mak [1.3]:
        Force a space after -o for gcc make. The $(NULL) macro method is the
        same as is used by the gs make (see comments in gs.mak)
        

Thu Jan 14 08:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * NEWS-COM [1.9]:
        chinook check-in.

Version 1.07 (01/01/99)
=======================

Mon Jan  6 22:00:00 1999        Marcos H. Woehrmann        marcos@artifex.com

        * watcdefs.mak [1.4], sgidefs.mak [1.4], msvcdefs.mak [1.5], gccdefs.mak [1.4]:
        Fixed problem with version number under msvc (and watcom).

Mon Jan  4 05:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * ugcc_top.mak [1.13]:
        Changes to allow use of make -f <top level makefile>.  It is no longer
        necessary to create a copy or link of the top level makefile, thought
        it is still supported.

Mon Dec 22 20:00:00 1998        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * watc_top.mak [1.3], ugcc_top.mak [1.12], sgi_top.mak [1.6], msvc_top.mak [1.9]:
        Prefixes devices with $(DD) and moves zlib configuration variable
        initialization to the to the top level unix makefiles.  Someone else
        will need to check the other makefile systems.  This change requires
        that we set ZLIB variable in # PLATFORMS SUPPORTED * 2 (pcl and XL)
        places instead of one, but will allow the code to be compiled with
        gs5.66.

Mon Dec  9 05:00:00 1998        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * NEWS-COM [1.8]:
        This news file should have been checked in with "indiansummer".
