Ghostscript PCL5e, PCL5c and PXL documentation is in doc/index.htm
License is in Public.htm

We encourage you to read the documentation and licence information but
the software can be quickly built and installed on many unix systems
by executing these commands.

make
make test
make install

`make test' will run the pcl6 interpreter with the X11 device in
interactive mode.  You must press return after each page is displayed.

Note for cygwin users

make CYGWIN=TRUE
make install

The CYGWIN variable will not include devices that depend on threads or
X11, neither are supported by the default cygwin system.
