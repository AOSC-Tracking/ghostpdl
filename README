Ghostscript PCL5e, PCL5c and PXL documentation is in doc/index.htm
License is in Public.htm

We encourage you to read the documentation and licence information but
the software can be quickly built and installed on many unix systems
by executing these commands.  Do not type the number or the period
before each command.

1. make fonts  # installs truetype fonts.
2. make        # use make debug for a diagnostic system.
3. make test   # run a pcl and pxl job using the default display device.
4. make install


1. and 4. may require administrator privelages.

Note for cygwin users

make CYGWIN=TRUE
make install

The CYGWIN variable will not include devices that depend on threads or
X11, neither are supported by the default cygwin system.

To build with a different font scaler use:

make PL_SCALER=afs ... # build using the Artifex Font scaler also the default.
make PL_SCALER=ufst ...# build with the AGFA Font Scaler.

We recommend doing a clean make prior to the changing the font scaler.

The default location for the fonts is /windows/fonts.  If the fonts
are placed in another location the environment variable PCLFONTSOURCE
must be set accordingly.  See the documentation for more details.
