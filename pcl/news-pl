This file, NEWS-PL, describes the changes in the most recent releases of
Aladdin's library code that is shared between PCL5, HP-GL/2, HP RTL, and PCL
XL, in reverse chronological order.

We do not currently track this library as a separate released object; we
include it in PCL5 and PCL XL releases.  Therefore, changes are noted only
by date.

1/13/97
-------

Updates the dingbats symbol sets to be more complete, and to use a MSL
mapping.  (plsymbol.c)

1/10/97
-------

Initializes the new library accurate curves flag to true.  (plmain.c)

1/9/97
------

Moves code for printing usage statistics (time, # of pages printed, memory
usage) into the library.  (plmain.h, plmain.c)

Limits the size of the initially allocated glyph tables, in case a client
asks for an unreasonably large one (as do some of the Genoa tests).
(plchar.c)

Corrects a misleading error message.  (plmain.c)

Greatly speeds up the generation of pseudo-bold characters, by replacing an
O(N) algorithm with an O(log N) one.  (plchar.c)
