This file, NEWS-PL, describes the changes in the most recent releases of
Aladdin's library code that is shared between PCL5, HP-GL/2, HP RTL, and PCL
XL, in reverse chronological order.

We do not currently track this library as a separate released object; we
include it in PCL5 and PCL XL releases.  Therefore, changes are noted only
by date.

2/21/97
-------

Fixes bugs:
	- pl_dict_lookup returned false rather than NULL in the failure
case.  (This didn't affect its functioning, only its readability.)
(pldict.c)
	- The parameter lists for macros accessing font_char_width functions
were incorrect.  (plfont.h)
	- There was a duplicate entry for Unicode 19U.  (plsymbol.c)
	- TrueType fonts didn't set the pitch_100ths value in the font
structure.  (plfont.h, plfont.c)

Extends the dictionary interface to allow lookups with or without searching
the stack.  (pldict.h, pldict.c)

2/6/97
------

Fixes bugs:
	- In downloaded fonts with more than about 300 characters, some
characters could get lost.  (plchar.c)

1/30/97
-------

Adds recognition of @-files on the command line.  (pcllib.mak, plmain.h,
plmain.c)

1/24/97
-------

Adds a -K<maxK> switch to impose a limit on the total space allocated.
(plmain.c)

Includes the time and memory printing code even in non-DEBUG configurations.
(plmain.c)

1/21/97 (after PCL XL 1.08)
-------

Makes the command line interpreter recognize # as equivalent to =, to get
around the Watcom implementation's bug of making = equivalent to space.
(plmain.c)

1/18/97
-------

Makes available the procedure for looking up a value in a TrueType-style
cmap sub-table, since we plan to use it for mapping between glyph
vocabularies.  (plfont.h, plchar.c)

1/15/97
-------

Corrects some minor errors in the symbol sets, and resolves the issue of the
duplicate Desktop set.  (plsymbol.c)

1/13/97
-------

Updates the dingbats symbol sets to be more complete, and to use a MSL
mapping.  (plsymbol.c)

1/10/97
-------

Initializes the new library accurate curves flag to true.  (plmain.c)

1/9/97
------

Moves code for printing usage statistics (time, # of pages printed, memory
usage) into the library.  (plmain.h, plmain.c)

Limits the size of the initially allocated glyph tables, in case a client
asks for an unreasonably large one (as do some of the Genoa tests).
(plchar.c)

Corrects a misleading error message.  (plmain.c)

Greatly speeds up the generation of pseudo-bold characters, by replacing an
O(N) algorithm with an O(log N) one.  (plchar.c)
