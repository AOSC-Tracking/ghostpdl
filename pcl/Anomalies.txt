This is a very incomplete list of anomalies (expected differences that are not
errors) in the PCL 5c FTS output when comparing the Artifex PCL interpreter
with the HP Color LaserJet 5/5M.


310, 320:

      These two panels are printed with the printer's "line printer" font.
      On the HP DJ 1600C/CM and the CLJ 5/5M, this is a bitmap font that is
      not scalable and is offered in only one size, hence its size does not
      change with pitch. On the Artifex system, the scalable Courier font is
      substituted for the line printer font. This font does change pitch as
      requested in the tests.


701:
      The length of the bitarray for the third and fourth pair of raster
      (magenta and yellow) differ from those on the HP CLJ 5/5M.

      The ouptut of the Artifex interpreter matches that of the HP DJ 1600C/CM.
      The output of the CLJ 5/5M is contrary to the documentation, and likely
      a limitation of the particular implementation due to the interaction
      between rasters and the hardware dither method.


800 - 804:

      Each of the "bars" in each test are rendered in a different color space,
      in the sequence RGB, CMY, ColorMetric RGB, CIE L*a*b*, Luminance-
      Chrominance. The final three bars are in device independent color spaces,
      hence there appearance will vary based on the color rendering
      dictionary provided.

      Note, in particular, that HP's implementation of the CID L*a*b* color
      space varies pronouncedly from that used in the Artifex interpreter.
      The latter matches what is documented for L*a*b* and what is used in
      PostScript. We have no idea where HP's concept for CIE L*a*b* came from
      (e.g.: how does one get something other than black for an L value
      near 0?).


811
      The third raster is implemented using the colormetric RGB color space.
      This space is not supported on the CLJ 5/5M, but is supported by the
      Artifex PCL interpreter. On the CLJ 5/5M, the color space specification
      is discarded, the default RGB color space is used, and a speical lookup
      table is installed. Hence, the results will be (nearly) identical to the
      prior raster for the CLJ 5/5M, but not for the Artifex interpreter.

      The fourth raster has a somewhat different appearance because the
      Artifex PCL interpreter uses a standard L*a*b* color space, while the
      CLJ 5/5M uses a very non-standard one.

      The fifth raster is done in the Luminance-Chrominance color space. It
      isn't clear yet which output is "correct" for this case. Further work
      will be required.


813:
      The firs two rasters are printed in RGB and CMY color spaces, with the
      white and black points reveresed. Due to an error in the implementation
      of transparency in the CLJ 5/5M, this causes BOTH white and black to be
      considered transparent, which in turn causes the center region to be
      full transparent.

      The Artifex impelementation does not have this bug, hence either the
      black triangles or the black background of this region is visible.

      The third raster is implemented using the colormetric RGB color space.
      This space is not supported on the CLJ 5/5M, but is supported by the
      Artifex PCL interpreter. On the CLJ 5/5M, the color space specification
      is discarded, the default RGB color space is used, and a speical lookup
      table is installed. Hence, the results will be identical to the
      prior raster for the CLJ 5/5M (minus the transparency bug - white and
      black points are no longer reversed).

      The fourth raster has a somewhat different appearance because the
      Artifex PCL interpreter uses a standard L*a*b* color space, while the
      CLJ 5/5M uses a very non-standard one.

      The fifth raster is done in the Luminance-Chrominance color space. It
      isn't clear yet which output is "correct" for this case. Further work
      will be required.


956:

      The rectangle on the right is printed with a transparent pattern. This
      produces the expected output on the HP 1600C/CM and on the Artifex PCL
      interpreter. It does not produce the expected output for the HP CLJ 5/5M,
      apparently due to a bug in the implementation of transparency on that
      device.


974, 975, 976:

      The HP Color LaserJet 5/5M does not support user defined dithers, while
      the Artifex PCL 5c interpreter does. Hence, these panels make use of
      of user defined dithers, hence their appearance will not be the same
      on the Artifex interpreter as on the CLJ 5/5M.


2230:

      Copies are handled by the device, not by the interpreter. Hence, it is
      quite possible that there will be only one page of output for this
      test.


2330:

     The CLJ 5/5M does not support the viewing illuminant command; the Artifex
     PCL interpret does.
