Version 1.30 (08/25/99)
=======================

Wed Aug 25 17:00:00 1999 GMT        Marcos H. Woehrmann    marcos@artifex.com

        * pcl.mak [1.32]:
        Changed version number for release.
        

Wed Aug 25 16:00:00 1999 GMT        Marcos H. Woehrmann    marcos@artifex.com

        * pcl.mak [1.31]:
        Changed version number to 1.10.
        

Wed Aug 25 07:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcursor.c [1.15]:
        Horizontal relative cursor motion logical error fixed.  Relative
        cursor positions less than 0 were not handled correctly.
        

Tue Aug 24 06:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcpage.c [1.29]:
        Contrary to the documentation perforation skip does not reset the vertical
        margins.
        

Tue Aug 24 01:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcpage.c [1.28]:
        setting the top margin has the side effect of resetting the y
        component of the pcl cap.
        
        * pctop.c [1.6]:
        adds initialization for language personality.
        

Thu Aug 19 08:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcl.mak [1.30.2.1]:
        whitespace change.
        

Tue Aug 17 23:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * rtmisc.c [1.11], pcuptrn.c [1.16]:
        clears the current path before entering gl/2 and adds support for an
        undocumented user defined pattern type, format 20.
        

Fri Aug 13 17:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcl.mak [1.30]:
        branches:  1.30.2;
        Misspelling of a device resulted in not including initialization code
        for the pgcolor module.  Fixes black background regression present in
        many of the ats files.
        

Wed Jul 28 03:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pctop.c [1.5], pcsymbol.c [1.12]:
        loading of the built in symbol sets is now a private procedure in
        pcsymbol.c, invoked by the reset code.
        

Tue Jul 27 05:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcfont.c [1.20]:
        When a font is selected by id simply decache and let it be reselected
        when it is required.
        
        * pcsfont.c [1.16]:
        Workaround - dictionary synynyms do not work properly with dictionary
        enumerations when deleting all fonts.  To work around this the
        enumeration is reinitialized each time a font is deleted.
        
        * pgdraw.c [1.40]:
        The gl/2's clipping region is rounded slightly differently on the
        LJ6mp versus the Color Laserjet.  Code change to emulate the 6mp for
        now but work still in progress here.
        

Mon Jul 19 03:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * rtmisc.c [1.10], pglabel.c [1.22], pgdraw.h [1.8], pgdraw.c [1.39]:
        hpgl/2 clipping region was not being set properly when rendering
        characters (LB).  The current transformation matrix did not account
        for pcl text direction when the current position (cap) was imported
        into the gl/2 coordinate system.
        
        * pgchar.c [1.11], pcsfont.c [1.15], pcfsel.h [1.6], pcfsel.c [1.12], 
        pcfontst.h [1.3], pcfont.c [1.19]:
        Modification to always select fonts by id instead of selecting the
        font by id and subsequently depending on the selection parameters to
        uniquely determine the font.  Also a minor change to decache the
        currently selected gl/2 font when pcl fonts are decached, this
        behavior is not documented in PCLTRM.
        
        * pcuptrn.c [1.15]:
        Apparently raster fill unlike other fills take the resolution of the
        device not the PCL documented 300dpi.
        

Thu Jun 17 20:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcsfont.c [1.14], pclfont.c [1.10], pcfont.c [1.18]:
        releases pxl error page font and enumeration when shutting down an
        interpreter instance.  This required adding support to pl_font_t for
        fonts with permenent data (data that should not be freed).
        

Wed Jun 16 02:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcmacros.c [1.9]:
        release macro dictionary for permanent resets.
        

Tue Jun 15 19:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcht.c [1.17]:
        revert back to our old reference count hacking.  TODO: we initialize a
        new color mapper device each time the rendering method changes,
        requiring the hack to the reference counts.  It would be much simpler
        to set the rendering method by setting a parameter using one color
        mapping device instead of juggling 4 separate color mapper devices.  A
        project for another day.
        
        * pcpalet.c [1.15]:
        release of the default and current palette for permanent resets.  Also
        removes an unnecessary call to pcl_set_drawing_color() apparently used
        to track down memory leaks.
        
        * pcstate.h [1.21]:
        prototype for pcl_free_gstate_stk().
        
        * pcfrgrnd.c [1.5]:
        removes final references to current halftone, crd, color space  and foreground
        objects for permanent resets.
        
        * pcdraw.c [1.10]:
        function to deallocate the pcl graphics state stack to be done during
        interpreter deinit.
        

Mon Jun 14 04:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pctop.c [1.4]:
        adds assertions about the current device (bbox and special color
        mapper) as pcl is shutdown.  Free's pcl graphics state upon shutdown.
        

Mon Jun 14 03:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pctext.c [1.18]:
        pcl now gets the advance vector for each character directly from the
        fonts for better performance.  Previously gs_show_width() was used.
        Also, obsolete font substitution has been removed.
        
        * pcfont.c [1.17]:
        Adds decaching for fonts for shift in, shift out, and selection by id.
        This was previously done awkwardly in pctext.c
        

Mon Jun  7 05:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pginit.c [1.13]:
        frees polygon buffer when there is a permenant reset.
        
        * pcsymbol.c [1.11]:
        frees soft and internal symbol sets when there is a permanent reset.
        
        * pctop.c [1.3], pcl.mak [1.29]:
        adds debugging assertions for current devices while devices are being
        removed from the pcl interpreter's instance.
        

Sun Jun  6 04:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pclver.h [1.3]:
        remove automatically generated version file that was accidentally
        added to the repository.
        

Sun Jun  6 00:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pctop.c [1.2], pcsymbol.c [1.10], pcommand.h [1.8], pclver.h [1.2], 
        pcfont.c [1.16]:
        Adds a new pcl reset type, pcl_reset_permenant, used to get
        rid of pcl permenant objects and internal objects normally
        maintained across job boundaries. Adds functionality for
        releasing the pcl the internal fonts.  Moves loading of symbol
        out of pctop.c.
        

Wed Jun  2 03:00:00 1999 GMT            johnd@artifex.com

        * pgparse.c [1.8], pgmand.h [1.9], pcursor.c [1.14], pctop.h [1.1], 
        pctop.c [1.1], pcstate.h [1.20], pcsfont.c [1.13], pcpage.c [1.27], 
        pcommand.c [1.13], pcmain.c [1.33], pclver.h [1.1], pclfont.c [1.9], 
        pcl_watc.mak [1.7], pcl_ugcc.mak [1.21], pcl_top.mak [1.17], 
        pcl_sgi.mak [1.8], pcl_msvc.mak [1.6], pcl.mak [1.28], pcjob.c [1.13], 
        pcimpl.c [1.1], pcfont.c [1.15]:
        Initial checkin for multiple language support, shared devices,
        interpreter instances, interpreter initialization/de-initialization,
        etc.  A todo list of unfinished work is in pctop.c and pxtop.c.
        

Thu May 27 07:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcht.c [1.16]:
        casts color mapper devices to normal devices for gx_device_retain and
        fixes a typo.
        
        * pcpage.c [1.26], pcmain.c [1.32], pcl_top.mak [1.16]:
        replace gsgc.h include with gsnogc.h
        

Wed May 26 06:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcht.c [1.15]:
        replaces reference counting hack with gx_device_retain().
        
        * pcht.c [1.14]:
        adds calls to gx_device_retain, so that the color mapper devices will
        not be inadvertantly freed.
        

Tue May 25 07:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcl_top.mak [1.15], pcl_msvc.mak [1.5]:
        gs5.84 integration.  Initialization of DD macro, initializes directory
        location for device (.dev) files
        

Mon May 24 20:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * rtraster.c [1.19], pcuptrn.c [1.14], pcpage.c [1.25], 
        pcmain.c [1.31], pcl_ugcc.mak [1.20], pccid.c [1.10]:
        initial gs5.84 checkin with pcl and xl compiling.
        

Tue May 18 02:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcursor.c [1.13]:
        fixes static removal regression.  The pcl cap can reside in the pcl
        state but is not really part of the modified print environment.  After
        macro invocation, copy back the cap to simulate this behavior.
        

Mon May 17 07:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcstate.h [1.19], pcparse.h [1.5], pcparse.c [1.9], pcpage.c [1.24], 
        pcommand.c [1.12], pcmain.c [1.30], pcmacros.c [1.8]:
        modifications to get max stack usage for pcl_execute_macro() down from
        56K to 38K.  To be continued.
        

Mon May 17 06:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pglabel.c [1.21]:
        corrects typo and fixes a compiler warning introduced in the last
        modification.
        

Mon May 17 05:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcuptrn.c [1.13]:
        removes unnecessary header file.
        
        * rtgmode.c [1.12]:
        raster source width and source height were calculated incorrectly when
        not given explicity.  This caused the bounds of the image to be larger
        than the extant the of the clipping rectangle for the page, resulting
        in expensive and unnecessary calls to gx_default_fill_triangle from
        the bbox device.
        
        * pgvector.c [1.12]:
        hpgl/2 will now allow round joins with beziers, other joins
        default to bevel.
        
        * pglabel.c [1.20]:
        The labeling code is now more liberal about using "show" and the
        graphics library character cache instead of drawing characters with
        the gl/2 line drawing code.  This change speeds up the fts about 20%.
        Effects on other test are not likely to be as significant since most
        applications don't use gl/2's LB as frequently as the fts tests.
        

Thu May 13 04:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pglfill.c [1.16]:
        removes obsolete comment.
        
        * pcuptrn.c [1.12]:
        properly initialize pattern reference point and orientation.
        

Wed May  5 03:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * rtraster.c [1.18], rtmisc.c [1.9], rtlrastr.c [1.6], rtgmode.c [1.11], 
        rtcursor.c [1.6], pgvector.c [1.11], pgstate.h [1.8], pgpoly.c [1.7], 
        pgparse.c [1.7], pgmand.h [1.8], pglfill.c [1.15], pglabel.c [1.19], 
        pgframe.c [1.9], pgconfig.c [1.15], pgcolor.c [1.6], pgchar.c [1.10],

        pcl.mak [1.27], pcjob.c [1.12], pcfont.c [1.14], pccprint.c [1.7], 
        pccolor.c [1.6], pccid.c [1.9]:
        Fixes 2 problems with polyline encoding: After PE is executed, the
        previous plotting mode (absolute or relative) is restored, but the pen
        up and down status is maintained.
        
        Simplification of RTL configurations - allows dynamic selection of
        commands in pcl or rtl mode.  The rtl interpreter will now run without
        TrueType fonts being loaded, only stick and arc fonts are accessed
        through hpgl's LB instruction.
        
        Unnecessary path clearing removed when plot mode changes.
        

Sun May  2 00:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pclfont.c [1.7]:
        PCL now exits with an error message(s) if internal fonts cannot be
        found.
        

Thu Apr 29 00:00:00 1999 GMT        Marcos H. Woehrmann    marcos@artifex.com

        * pcparse.c [1.7]:
        Changes to const and private for msvc.

        pcpage.h [1.4], pcpage.c [1.23], pcmain.c [1.29]:
        Modifications for RTL/GL2 mode, these changes are only relevant to RTL
        not pcl5c or pcl5e: (1) Adds rtl personality to pcl state and factory
        defaults (2) sets page size offsets to zero (3) changes clipping
        region to not use the pcl default setting of a 1/6" margin around the
        page (4) export pcl's new logical page and pcl's form feed procedure
        for use by gl/2's plot size (PS) and advance full page (PG) (5)
        Ignores text (6) Adds more implementations to plot size and advance
        page size (these commands are not complete) (7) defines rtl coordinate
        system for cases plot length < plot width and plot length > plot width
        (8) change gl/2 picture frame to have the same extant as the logical
        page size. (9) defaults gl/2's anchor point to have coordinate 0, 0
        (having no effect on the coordinate system).
        

Mon Apr 26 06:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcpalet.c [1.13]:
        modification to get around const warning.
        

Mon Apr 19 20:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcmain.c [1.28]:
        removes external declarations that are now properly done in gxalloc.h.
        

Wed Apr 14 08:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pcstate.h [1.17], pcpalet.c [1.12], pcindxed.h [1.5], 
        pcindxed.c [1.4]:
        Removes a global variable and a static local to a function, both
        supporting indexed color spaces.
        

Tue Apr 13 20:00:00 1999 GMT            ray@artifex.com

        * pgparse.c [1.6]:
        Add initialization for hpgl parser. Fixes exception error.
        

Tue Apr 13 06:00:00 1999 GMT            ray@artifex.com

        * pclookup.h [1.4]:
        Add extern to prevent multiple definition linker errors.
        
        * rtrstst.h [1.5]:
        Add comment delimiters following #endif to prevent warning.
        
        * rtrstcmp.h [1.4]:
        Add missing 'extern' to prevent multiple definition link errors.
        
        * pcpalet.c [1.11]:
        Change to use defining macro for pstack_entry (see change in pcpalet.h).
        This definition only here, others do not cause multiple def'n link errors.
        
        * pcpalet.h [1.7]:
        Add defining instance macro for pstack_entry to prevent multiple def'n
        link errors.

        * pcommand.c [1.10], pcmain.c [1.24]:
        Modified to use gs_state_setdeviceparams in lieue of gs_deviceparams.
        Removes redundant calls to gs_clippath() and gs_state_set_client().
        

Mon Mar  8 06:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * rtraster.c [1.15]:
        The "clearing" of planes not provided has been moved to the
        process_row routine (it was in transfer_raster_row). To
        facilitate this change the current compression mode is now an
        operand of process_row.
        
        The code that handles repeated rows in process_adaptive_compress
        has been modified to use its fast-case only if the number of planes
        is 1. Otherwise, it repeatedly calls process_row.
        
        The check test for nplanes == 1 in the adaptive compression case
        in add_raster_plane has been removed; the routine will now only
        check that the plane data is from a transfer_raster_row command
        rather than a transfer_raster_plane command.
        

Mon Mar  8 03:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pgvector.c [1.9]:
        more careful placement of the center point in CI to avoid inadvertant
        implicit closepath.
        

Mon Mar  8 00:00:00 1999 GMT        Henry Stiles    henrys@artifex.com

        * pgmand.h [1.6], pglfill.c [1.11], pgdraw.c [1.32], pgconfig.c [1.12]:
        more emulation of hp bugs: LT with no parameters does not in fact
        reset the line patterns it only sets the current line type to solid.
        


Version 1.07 (03/04/99)

        hpgl/2 does not free the polygon buffer when entering pcl.
        
        * pclfont.c [1.5]:
        Albertus Medium was incorrectly identified with weight 0 instead of 1.
        

Tue Mar  2 07:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * pgdraw.c [1.31]:
        new evidence from the ats test indicates the IW soft clip command
        defines a half-closed clip box and the hpgl/2 picture frame defines an
        closed clip box.  Also add more path and clip path debugging
        information for hpgl/2.
        

Mon Mar  1 08:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * pgconfig.c [1.11]:

Mon Mar  1 05:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * pgconfig.c [1.10]:
        2 current ctm fixes: SC does not reset the ctm before deriving the
        current user position in device space, and the routine to get the
        default picture frame did not properly restore the ctm.
        

Sun Feb 28 07:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * pglabel.c [1.15], pgdraw.c [1.30]:
        corrects label offset calculation when SI and SR are enabled.
        

Fri Feb 26 05:00:00 1999        Jan Stoeckenius,,,,        jan@artifex.com

        * pccid.c [1.7]:
        HP ignores the bits-per-primary setting for device-independent color
        spaces, and always uses [255, 0] as white and black reference points for these
        spaces.
        
        We have modified the routine check_cid_hdr in pccid.c to set bits-per-primary
        to 8 for all device-independent color spaces. The modified file is attached.
        

Thu Feb 25 09:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * pgvector.c [1.8]:
        It is not necessary to return to the starting point of a circle when
        drawing in polygon mode.
        

Thu Feb 25 08:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * rtgmode.c [1.7]:
        rtgmode.c was truncated at the last checkin (not analyzed).
        

Thu Feb 25 04:00:00 1999        Jan Stoeckenius,,,,        jan@artifex.com

        * rtgmode.c [1.6]:
        Fixes ats file floating poing rounding and truncating error.  For the
        particular transformation in effect, the initial horizontal position
        of 7008 centi-points would come back as 7007.9994... centi-points,
        which was converted to 7007 centipoints, which would come back as
        7006.9994... centi-points, and so on. The process finally stopped at
        about 6600 centi-points, due to a change in the least significant bit
        of the tx field of transformation matrix.  Now we round the calculated
        centipoint position before converting to an integer.

        * rtraster.c [1.13]:
        Added check for adaptive compression mode in transfer_raster_row()
        to avoid duplicating last line of raster data (fixes fts.0717).
        

Sun Feb 14 06:00:00 1999                marcos@artifex.com

        * rtraster.c [1.12]:
        Fixed problem with adaptive compression (if the last command was repeat
        previous row it was ignored, showed up in adaptivecompression.pcl).

        * pgfont.c [1.3], pgdraw.c [1.27]:
        all labels use round caps and round joins.
        

Fri Feb 12 05:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * rtraster.c [1.11]:
        removes optimization that prints raster as rectangle.  The code only
        worked properly with short edge feed devices.  We might reimplement
        this in the future if this part of the code is indeed a performance
        bottleneck.

        pginit.c [1.10], pgdraw.c [1.26], Anomalies.txt [1.10]:
        Improvement of fill line anchoring in gl/2.  Now use gl/2's position
        in user space instead of tracking device space position, which
        resulted in rounding errors when tranforming and doing comparisons.
        Label code updated to use gl/2 line drawing instead of using gs
        functions directly.  Also we now draw the current path when the for
        relative/absolution mode changes in the pen.  Updates Anomalies.txt to
        reflect changes.
        

Thu Feb 11 18:00:00 1999                ray@artifex.com

        * pcl.mak [1.20]:
        Remove the extra space after $(O_). This messes up platforms which cannot
        have a space. Correct fix is to define O_ correctly for platforms that
        require a space. See common/unixdefs.mak where O_=-o $(NULL).

        * pgdraw.c [1.23]:
        set dot orientation immediately after setting the ctm.
        
        * pgvector.c [1.6]:
        a hack to clear the current path before printing bezier curves.  The
        drawing machinery is not set up to apply line joins between lines and
        curves.  Lines of zero length are frequently used to set up for
        drawing a bezier.  We clear these points so they will not print as
        "orthogonal dots".

        * pgdraw.c [1.21]:
        modifications to support dot orientation.  HPGL/2 dots (zero length
        lines) are always drawn parallel to the HPGL/2 X-axis.  Also, makes
        dot orientation independent of device space.

Mon Jan  5 23:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * pglfill.c [1.6]:
        hpgl_RF() was not properly saving and restoring the index when the
        parser ran out of data and reinvokes hpgl_RF().

Mon Jan  4 14:00:00 1999        Henry Stiles        henrys@artifex.com

        * pcmain.c [1.19], pcl_top.mak [1.10]:

        normalizes min max range value when they are parsed from the long form
        of the cid command.  Previously the decode procedures accounted for
        the normalization.  Also a hack in pcpatrn.c to force install of cie
        even if the current pen is white.  The last change is incorrect and
        will take a different form in the next release.

        Prefixes devices with $(DD) and moves zlib configuration variable
        initialization to the to the top level unix makefiles.  Someone else
        will need to check the other makefile systems.  This change requires
        that we set ZLIB variable in # PLATFORMS SUPPORTED * 2 (pcl and XL)
        places instead of one, but will allow the code to be compiled with
        gs5.66.

        for positioning after drawing to set the current position to the
        center of the circle.  It is not necessary to leave this moveto in the
        path, adding the point has already updated the current position.
        
        * pgdraw.c [1.15]:
        (1) comments to indicate setting of the current line width is wrong,
        (2) Saves and restores the CTM "around" setting plu ctm and stroking
        gl line fills, and (3) adds warning message for bogus picture frame.

        pccrd.c [1.6]:
        Change to set the target device in pcl's state.  Adds accessor
        functions to set and get the target device. Modifies all put param
        like functions in pcl to use the real device.

	* pcl_ugcc.mak: adds tiff devices to the makefile.

	* Anomalies.txt: A new file that describes known anomalies.

Mon Sep 14 05:28:27 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcparam.h: modifications so pcl can request page sizes.

Fri Sep 11 03:42:59 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcpage.c, pcparam.h:
	reverts page device media changes to support cljet5.

Thu Sep 10 17:07:39 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcl_msvc.mak: adds broken msvc files for shipment to johnd's.

	* pcpatrn.c: removes SGI NFS null from the end of a file.

	* pcl_ugcc.mak: removes cljet driver temporarily.

Tue Sep  8 07:35:55 1998  Red Hat Linux User  <jan@meerkat>

	* pcl.mak: adds .h file dependencies.

	* pcl_top.mak: changes to not compile main with debug.

	* pcsymbol.c:
	We were allocating extra for the symbol set codes but they are
	actually allocated through the structure allocation since the symbol
	code array is defined statically.

	* pctext.c:
	Modified the handling of the right text margin. It turns out that the case
	of no-line-wrap must be handle differently that the case in which line
	wrapping is enabled.

	* pcpatrn.c:
	Fixed typo in pattern_set_shade_gl: a solid pattern should be used for
	an unrecognized intensity if the intensity is > 0, not <= 0. This gave
	rise to an anomally on panel 1815 of the PCL 5c FTS.

	* pcpalet.c:
	Modified invocations of pcl_crd_build_default_crd to pass a pcl_state_t
	pointer rather than a memory structure pointer; see pccrd.h above.

	* pcmain.c: Modified code to not always define DEBUG.

	* pcindexed.c:
	Modified the code to handle the situation in which the black and white
	reference points for a component are the same. This is tested in the
	PCL 5c FTS.

	* pcht.h, pcht.c:
	Changed from a single color mapping device to multiple color mapping
	devices, one for each mapping type. This is needed because the
	rendering method used by the foreground may be different from that used
	by the palette (which, in turn, is used by a raster), so it is necessary
	to have two different color mapping device present at the same time.

	Added support for table-dither (mask, non-monotonic) halftones to be
	used with the (not fixed) built-in rendering methods.

	Added code to allow device-specific halftones and re-mapping arrays
	encoded as gs_param dictionaries to be read from the device on start-up.

	Added support for table dither halftones. Also provided a structure
	descriptor for pcl_ht_builtin_dither_t structures, as these may now need
	to be allocated when read from a device.

	* pccrd.c, pccrd.h:
	Added facility to read a device-specific CRD encoded as a gs_param
	dictionary.

	Changed the operand to pcl_crd_build_default_crd from a memory pointer
	to a pcl_state_t pointer. This is necessary to allow the default dictionary
	to be read from a device.

Mon Sep  7 02:02:19 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcsfont.c: bad revision.

Sun Sep  6 19:50:14 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcsymbol.c:
	fixes memory allocation problem introduced because a new field was
	added to the symbol set data structure.

Sat Sep  5 05:55:09 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcpage.c, pcparam.h, pcommand.c, pcl_sgi.mak, pcl_ugcc.mak:
	modifications to support paper size specification from pcl.

Fri Sep  4 02:47:44 1998  Red Hat Linux User  <jan@meerkat>

	* pcl.mak: add new header file dependencies.

Fri Sep  4 02:45:08 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcl.mak: update documentation.

Fri Sep  4 02:39:01 1998  Red Hat Linux User  <jan@meerkat>

	* pcl_top.mak: adds decmap device.

	* pcsymbol.c: Modified pcsymbol_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcbiptrn.c, pcbiptrn.h:
	Modified the shade pattern for the 11% - 20% case; this had been entered
	incorrectly previously.

	Added the "un-solid" pattern. This is a masked patter that has no
	foreground pixels. It is used with GL/2, as a solid white foreground
	is transparent in GL/2 (if GL's "source transparency" is set), but
	opaque in PCL.

	Added prototype for the pcl_pattern_get_unsolid_pattern.

	* pccprint.c:
	Modified the code for the pixel placement operator for the new manner
	in which pixel placement information is kept in the PCL state.

	Modified the pccprint_do_reset routine to support overlay macros.

	* pcdraw.c:
	Added code to handle GL/2's source transparency separately from PCL's
	pattern transparency. The two parameters have the same effect (all
	GL/2 objects are masks, and hence do not support notion of "source"
	transparency similar to PCL's), but must be maintained independently
	in the PCL-GL/2 state.

	Turned off fill-adjust for all PCL objects. This used to (incorrectly)
	implement pixel placement, which is now implemented directly for
	rectangles (the only object affected by pixel placement for most
	printers (the CLJ 5/5M allows pixel placement to also affect scalable
	characters)).

	* pcht.c:
	Modified to support color-mapping as part of a rendering method, and to
	support monochrome mode.

	As part of this change, the never-used device field of the rend_info_t
	structure is replaced with a color mapping parameter, which is used
	with a color-mapping forwarding device that is always present.

	To support monochrome mode, the nature of the remapping array has been
	change somewhat, and the render_method field of the pcl_ht_t structure
	modified to be the mapped rather than raw rendering method. Fields for
	print mode (monochrome or color) and raw rendering method have been
	added to the PCL state.

	* pcht.h:
	Added prototype for the new procedure pcl_ht_set_print_mode, which
	can be used to set monochrome or colored print mode.

	Changed the render_method field/operand to be unsigned.

	* pcindexed.h, pcindexed.c:
	Generalixed the pcl_cs_indexed_0_is_{black | white} routines to check
	for the blackness or whiteness of any entry. The routines are now know
	as pcl_cs_indexed_is_{black | white}.  Replaced prototypes for
	pcl_cs_indexed_0_is_{black | white} with those for
	pcl_cs_indexed_is_{black | white}. Defined macros to correspond to the
	former prototypes, for backwards compatibility.

	* pcfont.c, pcmacros.c, pcjob.c:
	Modified pcmacros_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcmain.c:
	Added a pair of calls to gs_reclaim prior to running the first job.
	This is very important; until gs_reclaim is called for the first time,
	freed string objects are not recovered. Hence, the memory they use
	is lost.

	Added some debugging code to assist with memory leak detection.

	* pcmisc.c: Modified pcmisc_do_reset to support overlay marcos.

	* pcommand.c:
	Modifed pcl_init_state for the deletion of the grid_adjust field and the
	addition of the addition of the monochrome_mode and render_mode fields
	in the graphic state.

	* pcpage.c:
	Modified print quality command (<esc> * o # Q) to home the cursor.
	Modified pcpage_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcpalet.c: Added command for setting monochrome/normal print mode.

	Modified pcl_palette_set_render_method to reflect the addition of
	the render_mode field in the PCL state.

	Modified palette_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcpalet.h: Changed render_method operand to be unsigned.

	* pcpatrn.c:
	Modified pattern_set_gl_RF to account for the fact that patterns defined
	with the RF command may be either masked or colored patterns, and in the
	former case are fully transparent if GL/2's source transparency is set and
	the current pen is white. Also modified this routine to use the current
	pen if the pattern does not exist, even if the applicable SV or FT command
	specified using pen 1 (this requires a hack regarding the interpretation
	of the current pen operand when it is negative).

	Modified several other pattern_set_*_gl routines for mask patterns (shades,
	cross-hatch, user-defined) to make these fully transparent if the current
	pen is white.

	Also modified pattern_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcrect.c:
	Moved implementation of pixel placement for PCL objects to this module
	(rectangles are the only PCL object affected by pixel placement in
	this and most other PCL interpreters, including most but not all HP
	implementations.

	Modified pcrect_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcsfont.c: Modified pcsfont_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcstate.h:
	Added pcl_pattern_transparent field, so that PCL's pattern transparency
	setting and GL/2's source transparency setting may be separately
	maintained.

	Added the render_mode and monochrome_mode fields, to support the
	monochrome/normal print mode selection command.

	Replaced the grid_adjust field with the pp_mode field.

	* pcstatus.c: Modified pcsymbol_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pctext.c:
	Removed no longer needed invocation of gs_setfilladjust (for PCL, fill
	adjust is now always set to 0).

	Modified pctext_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pcuptrn.c:
	Modified pcl_pattern_RF to handle both colored and uncolored patterns
	created via the RF command.

	* pcursor.c: Modified pcursor_do_reset to support overlay macros.

	* pgconfig.c:
	Split the hpgl_DF command into two sections, one of which is accessible
	separately to support the reset required for overlay macros.

	* pgdraw.c:
	Modified the handling of patterns generated with the RF command to
	allow both colored and uncolored variations.

	Modified the manner in which the current pen is specified for
	uncolored patterns generated via the RF command. If pen 1 is desired,
	the opposite of the current pen is specified, to allow for the
	possibility that the pattern may not exist.

	Changed the handling of fill adjust to reflect the replacement of the
	grid_adjust state parameter with pp_mode (note that the actual
	implementation of pixel placement for GL objects is still broken).

	* pginit.c: Added support for overlay macros.

	* pglfill.c:
	Modified hpgl_FT to read and use the second optional parameter for
	mode 11 patterns (this is contrary to the documentation, but
	consistent with the SV command and has been empirically verified on
	two HP PCL implementations).

	Modified hpgl_RF to allow for both colored and uncolored patterns.

	* pgmand.h:
	Added prototype for the new procedure hpgl_reset_overlay. This is used to
	reset the GL/2 state prior to the execution of an overlay macro.

	* pgstate.h:
	1. Replaced the su_ union with the sp_ structure, and made the latter part
	of the fp_ structure consistent with the sp_ structure. Though not
	documented as such, for fills other than line fills the FT and SV
	commands are symmetric.

	2. Added the is_mask field to the rf_ structure. This is used to support
	uncolored patterns created via the RF command.

	* rtgmode.c: Modified gmode_do_reset to support overlay macros.

Tue Aug 25 19:18:59 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcl.mak: adds code to clean up gs generated files.

Mon Aug 24 08:03:18 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pcl.mak:
	removed device files from current working source directory that should
	not exist there in the first place...

Mon Aug 24 07:36:32 1998  Red Hat Linux User  <jan@meerkat>

	* pglabel.c: whitespace difference.

	* pcwhtindx.c:
	Fixed a bug/memory leak in pcl_cmap_map_raster. If a new raster array was
	allocated to hold the re-mapped pattern data, its pointer was never being
	placed in *pout_pixinfo.

	* pcuptrn.c:
	1. Modified code to support (up to) two rendered instances per pattern:
	   one mask and one colored.

	2. Modified the reset code to clear the pattern cache. This is an attempt
	   to limit memory fragmenation.

	* pcpatrn.h:
	Modified the pattern structure to be able to hold two rendered instances:
	one colored and one uncolored. This is an attempt to reduce memory
	thrashing due to the frequent and unnecessary re-allocation of mask
	patterns.

	* pcpatrn.c:
	Modified to the pattern handling code to allow for two rendered instances
	per pattern: one mask and one colored. This is an attempt to reduce
	memory thrashing due to the frequent and unnecessary re-allocation of
	mask patterns.

	* pcpalet.c:
	1.  Fixed a pair of memory-related problems in the push/pop palette code:
	    pop palettes were erroneously getting an extra reference, and the
	    palette stack global was not being set to NULL after the palette had
	    been cleared.

	2.  Removed code in build_default_palette that undefined the current
	    palette before redefining it. This avoids a release/allocate operation
	    for a dictionary entry that otherwise would confuse the memory leak
	    detection tool.

	3.  Fixed a bug in a never-used case in pcl_palette_PW. If the palette
	    does not exist when this routine is called, it is created, but in the
	    earlier code the ppalet pointer was not being updated after the
	    creation.

	4.  Modified clear_palette_store to leave the current palette alone if it
	    already is the default palette. This simplifies work with the memory
	    leak detector. This change also moves the invocation of the
	    build_default_palette routine to this procedure from its various
	    callers.

	* pcmain.c:
	Moved the reporting points for the memory leak detection code to more
	convenient locations.

	* pcht.c:
	Fixed a memory leak in set_threshold_ht. A fourth threshold string was
	being generated to handle the case of a 4-color output device, but
	this was overwritting the red-component threshold array allocated
	previously.  Not output error occurred because the two arrays were
	meant to be the same, but the previously allocated array could no
	longer be freed.

	* pcfsel.c: *** empty log message ***

	* pccolor.c:
	Modified the set color component and assign color index commands to be
	permitted but ignored in raster graphics mode (i.e.: they do not end
	raster graphics mode). This is contrary to the documentation but
	matches the behavior of the CLJ 5/5M and DJ 1600C/CM. The effect is
	visible in PCL 5c FTS panel 845.

	* pcindexed.c:
	Fixed bug in pcl_cs_indexed_update_lookup_tbl. A new indexed color
	space may have been created via the "unshare" operation, but the color
	space pointer was never being updated. Hence, the lookup table was
	being modified in the old color space. This bug is visible on PCL 5c
	FTS panels 2410 and 2411.

	* pcmain.c, pcindexed.c, pcl.mak, pcht.c, pcfsel.c, pccolor.c:
	*** empty log message ***

Sun Aug 23 05:30:05 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* pgdraw.c:
	Work around to stroke lines gl/2 style fills individually instead of
	accumulating the entire fill in one path.  This guarantees that a
	fixed amount of memory will be used for fills.  It was changed to fix
	fts 1462 which creates a path that is much to large, not due to the
	size of the graphical object being filled but the algorithm fills from
	GL/2's anchor corner and clips the resulting fill to the graphical
	object.  We should find the equivalent maximum value for the anchor
	corner such that the coordinates are less than the X and Y origin
	coordinates of the bounding box of the object being filled.

Sun Aug 23 05:10:18 1998  Red Hat Linux User  <jan@meerkat>

	* rtraster.c:
	Modified to properly (if quite slowly) handle the case of a raster with
	source transaprency off but pattern transparency on.

	* pcwhtindx.c:
	Modified pcl_cmap_create_remap_ary to potentially provide a remap
	array if source of pattern transparency is set. This is necessary to
	support the "two part" image structure required for rendering images
	with opaque source\ s but transparent patterns. Also removed a remnant
	of the temporary hack that made all rasters opaque.

	* pctext.c: fills in a missing else.

	* pcpatrn.h:
	Added the "colored" bit to the pattern object, to indicate if it was
	rendered as a colored pattern.

	* pcpatrn.c:
	1.  Moved the retained copy of the special white base color space to
	pccsbase.c, and the retained copy of the default halftone to pcht.c.
	This improves modularity and simplifies work with memory leak
	detection tools.

	2.  Modified the rendering of uncolored, transparent, foreground
	patterns.  If the halftone or color rendering dictionary in the
	foreground varies from that in the current palette, these must be
	rendered as colored patterns (because the graphic library's state
	cannot retain two halftones).

	3.  Plugged a memory leak in render_pattern: the pattern instance of
	the previous pattern was not being released.

	4.  Added stub for the driver configuratioin command. This will absorb
	any data provided.

	* pcpalet.c:
	Modified to retain a copy of the default palette, and to set the
	default drawing color during initialization. This reduces memory
	thrashing slightly and simplies work with memory leak detection tools.

	* pcpage.c:
	Modified new_page_size to reset the default transformation in the graphic
	state. This is necessary for devices that feed different size sheets in
	different directions.

	* pcmain.c:
	Removed initialization of the PCL coordinate system; this is now
	handled in pcpage.c

	* pcindexed.h:
	Changed the third operand of pcl_cs_indexed_build_special to be a
	const byte pointer rather than a byte pointer. Also added the
	prototype for the new initialization routine pcl_cs_indexed_init.

	* pcindexed.c:
	Modified default pen widths to be in plotter units rather than
	millemeters.  Also modified to retain the default indexed color
	space. This reduces memory thrashing slightly, and makes working
	with memory leak detection tools simpler. The latter change requires
	the addition of the an intialization procedure, pcl_cs_indexed_init.

	* pcht.c:
	Modified to provide a default transfer map (color lookup table) for
	the default (K) component of the output. This is necessary to properly
	handle cases in which the provided transfer function for the other
	components is an inverting function, for otherwise the results will be
	very black.

	Also modified to maintain a copy of the default halftone, which is
	allocated at boot time. This reduces memory trhashing slight, but more
	significantly it greatly simplifies working with the memory leak
	detection tools.

	* pcfrgrnd.c:
	Modified to retain a copy of the default foreground. This reduces
	memory thrashing slightly, and more significantly simplifies work with
	memory leak detection tools.

	* pcdraw.c: Modified pcl_grestore to release the references held by the
	pcl_gstate_ids_t structure that will be discarded. This plugs a major
	memory leak.
	VS: ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	* pccsbase.h:
	Added prototype for initialization routine pcl_cs_base_init.

	* pccsbase.c: Modified to keep a copy of the special "white" color
	space. Previously, this was kept in pcpatrn.c, which was not ideal
	from a modularity point of view. As part of the change, an
	initialization routine, pcl_cs_base_init, has been added.

Thu Aug 20 20:56:10 1998  Henry Stiles  <henrys@meerkat>

	* Anomalies.txt: remove cvs anomalies

	* pglabel.c, pcindexed.c, pcmain.c:
	changes default translation (pcmain.c) to put pcl's origin correctly
	on devices that have a non-zero imageable area.  Also, pcl was not
	using the default plu to initialize line width and the character code
	was not properly initializing the line width prior to stroking
	"stroke" font characters.
